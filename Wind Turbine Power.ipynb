    "\n",
    "It is my intention, to use this repository to demonstrate my knowledge with relation to Machine Learning. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The project requires me to <i>\"create a web service that uses machine learning to make predictions based on the data set powerproduction\"</i>  <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set has already been supplied by the lecturer and I have added it to this repository as a csv file. I have also added the assessment file to the repository for clarity of the request of the assessment. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<i>\"The goal is to produce a model that accurately predicts wind turbine power output from wind speed values, as in the data set. <br>\n",
    "You must then develop a web service that will respond with predicted power values based on speed values sent as HTTP requests.\"</i>\n",
    "\n",
    "-----------\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Statement of Work\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a statement to confirm that the work submitted within this repository is my own work.\n",
    "Any information obtained via 3rd party as apart of my research has been referenced appropriately.\n",
    "I can therefore confirm that my submitted work is in line with the Quality Assurance Framework of GMIT.\n",

    "- <b> Why this project? </b>\n",
    "\n",
    "The project is based upon the provided dataset which contains figures relating to the speed and power output of power production. <br>\n",
    "The aim of the project is for the student to develop a web service that can make predictions based on this data set. <br>\n",
    "This project must all be done using Machine Learning involing HTTP requests which should provide responses with predicted power / output values. \n"
