I have been tasked with creating a project as apart of my assessment for this module. <br>
The project involves applying Machine Learning to the creation of a web service to make predictions on the dataset provided by the lecturer. <br>

This repository contains at a minimum:

<ol>
  <li>Jupyter Notebook</li>
  <li>Python Script</li>
  <li>Dataset File</li>
  <li>Assessment requirements: PDF document</li>
  <li>Dockerfile</li>
  <li>README file</li>
</ol>

<br>

#### To complete my project, I used the following tools and systems:
<ul>
  <li>Jupyter Notebook web application</li>
  <li>GitHub.com platform</li>
  <li>Python programming language</li>
  <li>Visual Studio Code softare</li>
  <li>Command Prompt (Windows command line interpreter)</li>
</ul>

#### How to re-create the enviornment used for this project:
- Create a repository on GitHub.com
  * I create all repositories using the following files as my standard setup: 1. README file, 2. gitignore file & 3. licence based on the language used in the repository. <i>This project requires further files to be created which will be added over time and referenced to explain the reason for each as added.</i>
  * Further information on creating a repository can be found here: https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github
- Clone the repository to your machine: https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository
  * I choose to do this as it allows you work on the repository locally on your machine and sync between the two locations.
- To work on the repository locally, the following steps will launch it on your machine:
  * Open Command Prompt (or the desired command line interpreter on your machine)
  * Navigate to the folder where your repository is stored on your machine - windows command is "cd + folder address"
  * When the command line shows the required folder enter the words 'jupyter notebook' and press Return/Enter
  * This then instructs your machine to open the Home folder of your Jupyter Notebook via a browser window, note that the URL will be your localhost address.
- When you have completed your commitment / work session and wish to save the changes made, you will need to commit the Jupyter notebook to your repository on Github.com
  * To do this, you first need to close all browser windows for Jupyter and return to your command line window
  * In the command line to break the connection to Jupter press the two keys 'Ctrl' and 'C'
  * Enter a series of commands which will get your machine and Github to verify any differences found and merge the work so it is all up to date. 
  * 1. git status, 2. git add ., 3. git commit -m "Add comment for work completed in this session", 4. git push
  * Once the above prompts have all ran through the command line without errors, I advise to check your repository via Github.com to ensure that the commitments have successfully appeared. Once verified, you may close the command line as shut down your machine with the knowledge that your work has successfully saved. If you have carried out any work directly to the repository on Github.com, you will need to add these files or edits to the clone on your machine so that they both match. To do this, you just need to use the command "git pull" which will check and add any amendments to the clone on your machine.
